			<div class="title">Source Code Release Policy</div>
			<p>Source code and files for my various <a href="http://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects">projects</a> is available upon request, within certain limitations. While I am more than happy to share code for research purposes, for a number of reasons I have not decided to publicly post source code. For some of my work, my code either builds upon (CIS460, CIS563,) or serves as the basis for (CIS565) various projects and assignments in courses at the University of Pennsylvania. As such, in order to prevent current and future students from unfairly circumventing assignments, I've decided not to openly post code related to those courses. Other coding projects are still in a state of active flux, and thus are not quite ready for primetime yet.
			<p>However, anyone who is interested in taking a look at a particular project and is not currently enrolled/will not be enrolled in a related academic course is free to write to me with a code request, and we can set up some sort of arrangement.
			<p>Also, for a small number of projects, I have been posting code to <a href="https://github.com/betajippity/">my Github account</a>. Anyone is free to look at my Github commits, but my latest code will not necessarily always be pushed to Github.
